# vending_machine_sample_test_plan
This is a sample test plan for an arbitrary vending machine, written in Gherkin syntax.

Constraints:
  -Test Plan creation is about 1hr of work.
  -Test Plan assumes generic testers and testing capability. (That is, no mechanical engineers here to go through the servo's)
  -Test Plan assumes manual testing, while open to automation extension through the Cucumber suite.
